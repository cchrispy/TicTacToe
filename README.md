# TicTacToe

### How to play  
The tic-tac-toe squares are numbered one through nine, starting from the top left ("one") to the bottom right ("nine"). When prompted, enter a valid square to toggle the square. Use the word rather than the number to identify the square (e.g. "one", "five", "nine"; not 1, 5, 9).

#### Prizes for the winner  
The loser buys the winner ice cream. No ifs ands or buts.
